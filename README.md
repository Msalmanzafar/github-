# How to group work on github 

#### Fore Leader:
+ First we chose leader(which person they control over authority to control all users).
+ Second one we create a repository(make sure your repository is public).
+ Then go to setting(your repository setting) and choose collaboration option and find your friends(stakeholders) then click to add.
+ Then create a file and commit it....
+ If you need branches then make sure atleast one commit available.

#### Fore Users

+ Login your github account.
+ Then you see first page, and see your left hand which one collaborate you.
+ Click on colabrate file and clone it 'URL'.
+ Then work carefull..
